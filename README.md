# Project Title: Sudoku Solver

### Statement
In our project, there will be a GUI display of a sudoku.  On the bottom of the display there will be a button that
says "solve".  When pressed, the brute force algorithm will begin stepping through the sudoku and attempt to solve
it.  There will also be an additional mode called "slow solve" that will pause for a short period of time in between
the solve.  This will allow the user to watch and understand the algorithm that solves the sudoku.

### Analysis
Most of the functions in the solver use recursive aspects to extract data about the sudoku.
The main solver function will be written iteratively.  The sudoku will be represented as an
object with many getters and setters.

### Data set or other source materials
We will not be getting any external data, the sudoku solver will be using puzzles that we give it.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
Once our program is complete, we will have a fully working sudoku solver that will be able to take any given sudoku puzzle and solve it. During our presentation we will use the slow solving part of our application to explain the algorithm that we used and to demo the product as well as a quick solve that will show how quickly our solution can solve a puzzle

### Evaluation of Results
We will know if our program works successfully if it is able to solve multiple different puzzles and can also display our algorithm fully working. 

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. 

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages.

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system. 

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
What additionally will be done in the last chunk of time?

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

### Connor McGrory @conno1234
I will write the solver for the sudoku for the first milestone.  For the second milestone I will adjust the code
to work with Yusuf's GUI.

### Yusuf Yildiz @yyildiz
For the first milestone I will be working on the GUI and the interactivity of the program which will allow the users to step through Connor's algorithm. For the second milestone, I will make the GUI work with Connors underlying algorithm implementation.
